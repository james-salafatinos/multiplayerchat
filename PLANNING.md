# Multiplayer ThreeJS Project Planning

## Vision
Ill describe how envision using it to continue to scale. Some elements i typically do is making a visual of data with threejs, and lots of other threejs visualizations and simulation/phsyiscs systesm, video games 3D tools basically. I've made games too. So making visuals, and like but what i would need in the future is scalable things from that visual purpsoe -- like Client fetch APIs,  webworkers, database, websockets (socket.io) for multiplayer, a multiplayer subsystem to support server authoritative mechanics for like an mmorpg game where players interact (there are character models) they interact with the 3d world, point and click movement, have banks/inventories, can chat to other players via "tab" to chat interface. 

Can you set up an MVP project with  simple threejs scene with an axes helper and a cube rotating (ECS), with a chat interface that is persistent on the database and multiplayer across clients?
## Project Architecture

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite for persistent chat storage
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io for multiplayer functionality

### Frontend
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with ECS (Entity Component System) architecture
- **UI**: HTML/CSS for chat interface
- **Client-Side Logic**: JavaScript modules

## Entity Component System (ECS)
We'll implement a simple ECS architecture for the 3D scene:
- **Entity**: Base game object (e.g., cube, player)
- **Component**: Data container attached to entities (e.g., position, rotation, material)
- **System**: Logic that processes entities with specific components (e.g., render system, physics system)
